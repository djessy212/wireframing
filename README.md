# wireframing
1. Layout Structure / Page Structure

Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the screen.

Shows how the page is divided (e.g., header, content area, sidebar, footer).

2. Content Placement

Indicates where text, images, videos, or other content will appear.

Often represented by placeholder boxes (e.g., grey boxes for images, horizontal lines for text).

3. Navigation

Shows the menu items, links, and navigation paths.

Could be a top nav bar, side menu, or breadcrumb trail.

4. User Interface (UI) Elements

Includes:

Buttons

Input fields

Checkboxes, toggles

Search bars

Represented simply, to focus on function, not style.

5. Call-to-Action (CTA) Elements

Buttons or links that prompt users to take an action (e.g., "Sign Up", "Buy Now").

6. Annotations or Notes (Optional)

Comments that explain the purpose or behavior of certain elements.

Helps communicate functionality to developers or stakeholders.

7. Flow Indicators

Arrows or numbering that show user paths or screen transitions.

Useful in multi-screen wireframes or prototypes.

8. Placeholder Text (Lorem Ipsum)

Used to demonstrate where real content will go, without needing final copy.

9. Responsiveness (Optional)

Some wireframes show variations for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
