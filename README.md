# wireframing
1. Layout Structure / Page Structure

Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the screen.

Shows how the page is divided (e.g., header, content area, sidebar, footer).

2. Content Placement

Indicates where text, images, videos, or other content will appear.

Often represented by placeholder boxes (e.g., grey boxes for images, horizontal lines for text).

3. Navigation

Shows the menu items, links, and navigation paths.

Could be a top nav bar, side menu, or breadcrumb trail.

4. User Interface (UI) Elements

Includes:

Buttons

Input fields

Checkboxes, toggles

Search bars

Represented simply, to focus on function, not style.

5. Call-to-Action (CTA) Elements

Buttons or links that prompt users to take an action (e.g., "Sign Up", "Buy Now").

6. Annotations or Notes (Optional)

Comments that explain the purpose or behavior of certain elements.

Helps communicate functionality to developers or stakeholders.

7. Flow Indicators

Arrows or numbering that show user paths or screen transitions.

Useful in multi-screen wireframes or prototypes.

8. Placeholder Text (Lorem Ipsum)

Used to demonstrate where real content will go, without needing final copy.

9. Responsiveness (Optional)

Some wireframes show variations for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Types of Wireframes

Low-Fidelity Wireframes
‚úÖ Definition:

Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are basic sketches or simplified digital layouts that outline the structure and flow of a user interface. They are not detailed and often lack color, images, or precise spacing.

‚úÖ Characteristics:

Rough and quick to create

Often hand-drawn or made with simple digital tools

Focus on layout, structure, and content hierarchy

Use placeholders like boxes and lines

Usually black and white or grayscale

No attention to typography or visual design

‚úÖ Used When:

Early in the design process

Brainstorming ideas

Gathering feedback on general layout and user flow

Collaborating with stakeholders or clients before committing to details

üîπ High-Fidelity Wireframes
‚úÖ Definition:

High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are detailed representations of the final product. They may closely resemble the finished design and often include actual content, UI components, and interactive elements.

‚úÖ Characteristics:

Pixel-precise layouts

Real text and images (or close to final)

Include fonts, colors, icons, and branding

May simulate interactions (clicks, hovers, transitions)

Often built in tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch

‚úÖ Used When:

Later in the design process

Preparing for usability testing or stakeholder review

Communicating detailed functionality to developers

Getting closer to hand-off for development

üîÅ Summary Table:
Feature	Low-Fidelity Wireframe	High-Fidelity Wireframe
Detail Level	Low (basic shapes, placeholders)	High (actual content, design elements)
Visual Design	None or minimal	Includes branding, typography, colors
Tools Used	Paper, Balsamiq, pen & paper	Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch
Speed to Create	Fast and simple	Time-consuming and detailed
Purpose	Brainstorming, early feedback	Final layout, developer handoff
User Testing	Early concept testing	More realistic usability testing
üõ†Ô∏è When to Use Each:

Use Low-Fidelity Wireframes:
‚Üí When you're in the early ideation stage, want quick feedback, or are exploring multiple layout options.

Use High-Fidelity Wireframes:
‚Üí When you're refining the design for usability testing, stakeholder approval, or ready for handoff to developers.
